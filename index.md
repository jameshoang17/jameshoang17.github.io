### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was easily a top 3 lab experience for me since I found myself
    searching "How many days since x date" on Google a lot; learning the
    information and code that went into the algorithm was interesting and
    fun to engage with.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was the first lab that I found myself constantly looking back
    at even weeks later. I already had a bit of prior knowledge of computer
    science, and this lab's topics felt like the first "new" thing that I had
    seen. As such, it was the first lab that I felt challenged by.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was very memorable to me and I'd like to say it was my favorite
    lab. Me and my lab partner, Joseph, had pretty good teamwork while working on
    the lab parts together, we did lab procedures pretty spot-on and used the
    allotted time effectively.
